# javascript-headless-ecommerce

2 Mock ups using Vendure back end eCommerce api, port 3000, with a Next JS front End, and a Nuxt Vue JS front end with custom Vue StorefrontUI components (ongoing project, feel free to contribute!)

Nuxt does not seem to have a connecter for Vendure yet, so vue-nuxt-storefront-ui is for arranging a suitable Vendure api connection for vanilla Nuxt app, and also to use some of the Storefront UI components in order to build custom ecommerce site with Vendure back end without relying on the main Vue Storefront repo.


Has demo of the original Storefront at http://six-fowl.surge.sh/

and also the original Storefront Demo is in this repo.
